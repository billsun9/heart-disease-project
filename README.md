# heart-disease-project

In this project, I trained multiple machine learning models using the scikit-learn library in Python (Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier).

The heart disease dataset (data.csv) used for training was collected by the Long Beach and Cleveland Clinic Foundation. The associated code for training and testing is located in train_1.py and train_2.py

To allow for greater user accessibility, I hosted these models on a web application using Flask. The HTML for the website is in the templates directory, and the HTML and CSS is in the static directory. 

The web application is located at https://hearthelper.pythonanywhere.com/
